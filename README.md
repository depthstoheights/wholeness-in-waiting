# Wholeness in Waiting: A Single's Journey

## 📖 Biblical Foundation
> "I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation... I can do all this through him who gives me strength." - Philippians 4:12-13

A comprehensive, shame-free support system for Christian singles navigating sexual desire, loneliness, and the search for purpose in their season of singleness.

## 🙏 Ministry Purpose
This application addresses the church's silence around singleness and sexuality. Too often, singles are told to "just wait" without practical support for the very real challenges of celibacy, loneliness, and unmet desires. This tool provides honest, biblical, grace-filled guidance for thriving—not just surviving—as a single Christian.
